        <p><h3>Statement of Objective:</h3> My obective with this project is to start a portfolio showcasing my 
        progress as I learn to code from beginning to end. Hopefully I will be able to prove my ability to 
        ponttential clients and employers.

    <li>
        <p><h3>Education Level:</h3> Some college, High School diploma</p>
    </li>

    <li><p><h3>Work Experience:</h3> I have work in various manual labor positions such as janitor, forklift 
        operator, and trucking assistant. I do not have any coding experience or history, however, it has been
        a dream of mine for longer than I am comfortable with and I have decided to make it a reality.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li><p><h3>Skills:</h3> I honestly don't consider myself to be highly skilled. I have a decent grasp on technology
        and the neccesary curiousity to learn new software. I also learn fairly quickly when I become obsessive 
        about something. That said, I've always dedicated myself fully to the tasks in front of me.</p>
    </li>

    <li><p><h3>Awards and Achievements:</h3> As a result of dispassionatlely trudging forward I have not accumulated 
        any significant recognitions of achievement outside of high shcool.
